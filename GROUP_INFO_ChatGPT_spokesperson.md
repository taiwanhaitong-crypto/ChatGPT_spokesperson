## 📖 Group Information

### Group Name
**ChatGPT_spokesperson**

### Why This Name?
We chose **ChatGPT_spokesperson** because we do not understand this course and any coding/debugging at all. We just retell to others the ideas of ChatGPT, Doubao, Kimi, Gemini, or any other AI agent, no matter what. Any viewpoints we express are not our own viewpoints but the viewpoints of these AI agents. Our team only does two things: communicate effectively with AI agents and pass on their ideas to others.
